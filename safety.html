                    Listen to your gut feelings. If a situation feels uncomfortable or unsafe, trust your instincts and take action. It's better to be cautious and proactive than to ignore red flags.

                    <br>
                <li><strong>Learn Basic Self-Defense Techniques:</strong>
                    Enroll in a self-defense class to learn basic techniques for defending yourself. Focus on moves that are easy to remember and effective in various situations, such as breaking free from grabs or creating distance from an attacker.

                    Carry personal safety items, such as a whistle, personal alarm, or self-defense tool like pepper spray. These items can attract attention and provide a means to deter or escape from an attacker.
                    </li><br>
                <li><strong>Have a Safety Plan:</strong>
